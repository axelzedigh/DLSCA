# DLSCA

This repository is a work in progress. It is intended to be a GUI interface for some scripts used for research.
I am making it public so it will be easier to share with my coworkers, who are the reason I am making this more 
user friendly version of otherwise quite arcane scripts.

Install instructions:
1. conda create -n tensorflow_env python=3.6
2. conda activate tensorflow_env
3. conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow=1.12.0
4. conda install keras
5. pip install fbs
6. Clone this repository
7. That's it! Just run "python main.py"
